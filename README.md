This is an Excel project that I worked on with a data set given to me from another users GitHub account. 
The user only provided the raw file on a worksheet, however there are more worksheets that I added as I worked along. 

For this project, I went into the data and cleaned the data set in the "Working Sheet." 
  Here I changed columns to be more clear for the audience when they are shown the files.
  Added in a column using coding techniques in order to help the visualization become more clear.

Another sheet that I added is the "Pivot Table" sheet.
  I created 3 different pivot tables to show different perspectives for the audience.
  With these pivot tables, the audience is able to get a better understanding of what the data is showing in a different perspective.
  This sheet also comes with graphs. These graphs represent the pivot tables and gives a visualization for the audience as well.

Finally, I added a mock dashboard with resources that Excel can offer.
  With this dashboard, the audience will be able to see a clean and easy to understand idea of the bike sales.
  There are three graphs on the dashboard with slicers as well.
  These slicers are connected to all of the graphs and will give the audience a better understanding of how the data shows with the different customers.
